** TODO Configure spaceline                                     :improvement:
- spaceline-config.el has the current config

** TODO [#C] Semantic movement                                  :improvement:
*** Get the file hierarchy
- LSP: textDocument/documentSymbol
  - https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_documentSymbol
  - children is the intended source
  - containerName is a hacky posibility
  - also ranges could be used
- lsp-treemacs-symbols-list for reference
  - https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-treemacs
- potential helper: hierarchy
  - https://github.com/DamienCassou/hierarchy
- alternative: treesitter
  - https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/chnxzm/dynamic_module_binding_for_treesitter_an/
*** Tree movements
**** (next or prev) node
- File order should be depth first
**** (next or prev) sibling
- What to do at the end of sibling chain?
  - go up a level
    - temporarily or permanently?
  - continue to different branch of the tree
    - how many steps through higher level nodes would be allowed (1 or any)
  - revert to next node behaviour until jump to a lower level node would occur
    - save a cycle level
    - allow jumps to higher levels
    - disable jumps to lower levels
**** (next or prev) parent level node
- fall back to sibling at top level
**** In org-mode
- org has all these except next parent level
- siblings movement does not go up levels at all
- org-next-visible-heading
- org-previous-visible-heading
- org-forward-heading-same-level
- org-backward-heading-same-level
- outline-up-heading
*** Potential bindings
- Caps layer
- h for higher level
- l for lower level
- j and k for go up and down inside the level
*** Ivy / helm interface
- imenu might be good enough
- but automatic jump would be nice

- There needs to be a space between the bullets and point for it to work correctly
  - In list items this is not necessary
  - What actually controls this?
  - And can it be hacked?
- evil-move-beyond-eol is needed to make this possible
