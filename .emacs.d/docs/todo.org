** TODO Help

** TODO Full sized splits with earlier splits

** TODO Semantic movement [0/3]
*** TODO Figure out functionality and bindings
**** Tree movements
***** (next or prev) node
- File order should be depth first
***** (next or prev) sibling
- What to do at the end of sibling chain?
  - go up a level
    - temporarily or permanently?
  - continue to different branch of the tree
    - how many steps through higher level nodes would be allowed (1 or any)
  - revert to next node behaviour until jump to a lower level node would occur
    - save a cycle level
    - allow jumps to higher levels
    - disable jumps to lower levels
  - Idea:
    - Allow to go via next higher level node
    - A - B - C - B - C can jump C to C via B
    - A - B - C - A - B - C can jump C to C via A - B
    - A - B - C - B - A - B - C cannot jump C to C, since the following B does not have C level node
    - A - B - C - A - B - B - A - C cannot jump C to C, since the following B does not have C level node
    - A - B - C - A - A - B - C cannot jump C to C, since the following A does not have C level node
***** (next or prev) parent level node
- fall back to sibling at top level
**** Current setup
- <left> sibling up
- <right> sibling down
- <up> and <down> for go up and down visible headings
- u to go to parent heading
**** Potential bindings
- <left> for higher level
- <right> for lower level
- <up> and <down> for go up and down inside the level
*** TODO Implement required functions for different major modes
**** org-mode
- org has all these except next parent level
- siblings movement does not go up levels at all
- org-next-visible-heading
- org-previous-visible-heading
- org-forward-heading-same-level
- org-backward-heading-same-level
- outline-up-heading
**** Prog modes
- LSP: textDocument/documentSymbol
  - https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_documentSymbol
  - children is the intended source
  - containerName is a hacky posibility
  - also ranges could be used
- lsp-treemacs-symbols-list for reference
  - https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-treemacs
- potential helper: hierarchy
  - https://github.com/DamienCassou/hierarchy
- alternative: treesitter

**** Magit
- magit-section-forward
- magit-section-backward
- magit-section-forward-sibling
- magit-section-backward-sibling
- magit-section-up
*** TODO Ivy / helm interface
- Swiper like search for document symbols
- imenu might be good enough
- but automatic jump would be nice

** TODO Save when switching buffers
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1413837/emacs-auto-save-on-switch-buffer
** TODO Emacs crashes if h is pressed at the end of a folded org heading
- Happens when line numbers are enabled
** TODO Load only specific things from custom file
- Custom file can contain old settings that were removed from init file
** TODO Find a way to do mode specific additions to prefix maps
- For example bind "; a" to lsp-execute-code-action
- generic function (handle)
- derived prefix maps
- Org-mode bindings work. Investigate why.
  - Regular ; bindings use evil global maps
  - org-mode binds with :states so to evil auxiliary maps
  - lsp binds without :states so minor mode maps
  - And the preference is evil-auxiliary > evil-global > minor-mode
  - Also evil probably does some magic so auxiliary binds work together with global binds
** TODO Investigate straight find failure
- Apparently `call-process` evaluates wildcards on windows

** EVAL org-cycle jumps to the beginning of line
- State "EVAL"       from "TODO"       [2019-08-20 Tue 14:16]
- There needs to be a space between the bullets and point for it to work correctly
  - In list items this is not necessary
  - What actually controls this?
  - And can it be hacked?
- evil-move-beyond-eol is needed to make this possible
