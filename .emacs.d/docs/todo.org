**** next or prev (<down> <up>)
File order corresponds to depth first movement in a tree
**** next or prev same level (<right> <left>)
Allow to go via one node that is one level higher:
  * C - B - C can jump C to C
  * B - A - C - C - B  can jump B to B as lower level nodes don't matter
  * C - A - B - C cannot jump C to C, because A is two levels higher
  * C - B - B - C cannot jump C to C, because the following B does not have C level node
**** next or prev higher level node (C-M-n C-M-p)
Fall back to sibling at top level

** TODO Save when switching buffers
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1413837/emacs-auto-save-on-switch-buffer
** TODO Emacs crashes if h is pressed at the end of a folded org heading
- Happens when line numbers are enabled
** TODO Find a way to do mode specific additions to prefix maps
- For example bind "; a" to lsp-execute-code-action
- generic function (handle)
- derived prefix maps
- Org-mode bindings work. Investigate why.
  - Regular ; bindings use evil global maps
  - org-mode binds with :states so to evil auxiliary maps
  - lsp binds without :states so minor mode maps
  - And the preference is evil-auxiliary > evil-global > minor-mode
  - Also evil probably does some magic so auxiliary binds work together with global binds
